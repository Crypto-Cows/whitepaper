# CRYPTO-COWS NFT
June 2022.

In few words:
- An NFT project that provide NFT collections that grants access to their holders to DE-FI features.
- An NFT brand that with his awareness wants to create a network of NFT projects.

# THE PROJECT

CRYPTO-COWS is an NFT project created on September 2021 originally by a small team with the target to expand it, people behind the project hardly believe in the use of Blockchain as an unstoppable, incensurable and decentralized system.

Our goals with this project are to create a strong NFT brand where our holders will access exclusive DE-FI features and become a reference point to other NFT projects in the sector creating a strong network of NFT projects that cooperate each otherâ€™s.

The project started in a total silent way: without any marketing strategy, just posting on social channels news about the development.

The first collection has been released in December 2021 without advertising, artworks are super simple, there was even no whitelist because we wanted to make it open for everyone who wants to join the CRYPTO-COWS collecting our NFTs. We did the launch of the collection on this way at first because we didn't want to make people grind for a whitelist spot for a project that has nothing more than NFTs to offer, we launched the collection with the 95% of the project features still under development so there was not a real utility, also the price for mint is very low, 15 Matic with the low fees of the Polygon Network where the project live. As the collection sales was going (and at the moment of writing this document on June 2022 are still ongoing) we are keep working on the development of the project features.

# POLYGON NETWORK

For the goal to provide DE-FI services for our holders and for the goal to create a strong network of NFT Projects, we are currently building a decentralized platform on the Polygon Network, the choice of Polygon has been made for avoid the high fees that Ethereum Network asks at the moment, making the platform accessible for all at low cost of fees.

The choice of the Polygon Network for our Decentralized Application is not binding to cooperate with NFT Projects that lives on Ethereum Network or BSC, Solana etc...


# PROJECT FEATURES

The holders of at least of 1 CRYPTO-COWS NFT will going to access the DE-FI features of our DAPP, that's the real utility that we are going to bring with the project.

The features of the DAPP are:

- Ranch
- Milking
- NFT Launchpad
- NFT Breeding

# RANCH

On the Ranch, connecting your wallet, you can see on our platform the NFTs that you own by CRYPTO-COWS NFT collections. This is a simple application where you can see your assets, see the parameters of your NFTs and interact with them by pressing a heart-shaped button that will make your crypto-cows bellow, currently the Ranch has been released for web, and is under development for mobile because we want to make you bring your CRYPTO-COWS always with you on your phone.

# MILKING

CRYPTO-COWS are able to produce milk! When we talk about CRYPTO-COWS milking we are referring to NFT Staking that our holders will access. We are going to create periodically staking pools where is possible to stake CRYPTO-COWS, pools will be with a fixed locking time or with a flexible locking time period, as rewards for staking CRYPTO-COWS is possible to obtain CRYPTO-COWS MILK (CCM) tokens that is our utility token and will be explained more in details later on this document.

The goals for the NFT Staking are to bring earning features exclusives for our holders, and by locking CRYPTO-COWS on staking there will be a decrease in the total circulating supply for the goal of bring value by creating a shortage.

# NFT LAUNCHPAD

For the goal to create a network of NFT Projects that will cooperate, to give new projects visibility exploiting the strength of our brand we would like to create an NFT Launchpad, in common agreement with other NFT projects that will be selected with a very hard selection process. Staking pools will be created where our holders can participate by lock on staking NFTs by CRYPTO-COWS or CRYPTO-COWS MILK token. As reward for participating to the Launchpads will be offered as prize, by the project that will be launched, whitelist spots or a percentage of the total supply of the collection that is going to be launched or everything else the projects want to give as prize.

The goals for the NFT Launchpad are to bring earning features exclusives for our holders, and by locking CRYPTO-COWS or CRYPTO-COWS MILK token on staking there will be a decrease in the total circulating supply for the goal of bring value by creating a shortage.

# NFT BREEDING

This feature is more correlated to CRYPTO-COWS NFT collections but, if necessary, can be expanded to other projects that wants to give NFT rewards. Basically, the NFT Breeding feature consists on lock on stacking for a defined period of time 2 NFTs from the same or different collection and obtain as reward a new NFT from an existing collection or from a brand new one.

The goals for the NFT Breeding are to bring earning features exclusives for our holders, and by locking CRYPTO-COWS on staking there will be a decrease in the total circulating supply for the goal of bring value by creating a shortage.

# TOKEN

With the target to cover an additional aspect of the Blockchain environment, the CRYPTO-COWS NFT Project is going to launch their own token, CRYPTO-COWS MILK (CCM) token. This will bring more inclusiveness for our users that will have a token which represents the project. The token is the representation of the milk that is milked by the CRYPTO-COWS putting them in staking, so our holders will be able to obtain it for free from the CRYPTO-COWS staking pools (MILINKG). We don't want to create a farm and dump token, so there are various ways that will incentivize holding rather than selling:

- Governance
- Participation to NFT Launchpad

# GOVERNANCE

Periodically will be created pools where users will be able to express their will by voting, the number of tokens that you own will add more value to your vote. Governance voting will be done for define the future evolutions of the project, features to implement for expand the project, but our favourite way to use Governance is by let community vote about the new collections that we are going to create: let community decide critical aspects of the collections like the total supply, the rarities of the traits, the graphic styles of the artworks and more.

# TOKENOMICS

*Tokenomics will be defined and explained more in detail in future by upgrading this document section.*

Our plans for tokenomics are to reserve a small percentage of the total supply for ICOs and reserve a really small percentage for the team. Most of the supply will be left for NFT Staking rewards and to the free market.

# THE STARTUP

Details and goals of the CRYPTO-COWS NFT project are now clear and explained, what we want to do with the project is a new Blockchain Startup that when it will be officially created it will claim ownership of the CRYPTO-COWS project. The Startup (Name of the company, branding and everything related to the company image will be revealed at the moment of the creation) will cover several aspects on the Blockchain environment.

All the sectors that the Startup wants to cover:

- The main goals for the Startup are to provide consulting services for help people and companies on the Blockchain transition.

- To stay on the front line on the Blockchain transition that we are living, we also want to exploit our KNOW-HOW on the NFT and DE-FI environment for give to other projects, people or companies consulting services on creating their NFT projects and environments.

- For maintain the decentralization of the Blockchain network we already started testing a little mining farm powered with a solar energy system, it is important for the network to have miners for maintaining it decentralized and secure, we are doing it with 100% clean energy reducing co2 emissions to 0, and as the test is going fine, we plan to expand the farm by running more machines and hosting machines for people or companies that want to be into mining.
- Not only mining because there are even Proof of Stake networks that needs to be powered, with the Startup we plan to create validator machines for PoS networks, we also plan to incentivize the staking on our validators by giving NFTs as rewards for people who wants to contribute to maintain the decentralization of the Blockchain network with us.

- Game-Fi is a new sector that is growing rapidly, the Startup also wants at first to create their own Play to earn project, then as done with the NFT sector, use the KNOW-HOW acquired for give consulting services for projects and companies that wants to build their Game-Fi projects.

For this sectors that the Startup wants to cover, will be created teams that will interoperate between sectors and projects, every sector will have a leader and we plan to expand the teams empowering them as the company grows.
